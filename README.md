The Cinema Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and automate cinema operations. Developed using HTML, CSS, and Django, this project enables efficient handling of movie scheduling, ticket booking, and seat selection, aiming to streamline administrative tasks and enhance the user experience.

The system allows administrators to add and manage movie schedules with ease, while users can conveniently book tickets by selecting available shows and seats through an intuitive interface. The application ensures a smooth workflow between different cinema management functions, making it suitable for real-world deployment in small to mid-sized cinema businesses.

This project was created as part of an academic semester project and demonstrates core web development skills, including backend logic with Django, frontend interface design, and database integration using SQLite. The system can be run locally using Djangoâ€™s development server, and setup instructions are included in the repository.

If you're interested in trying out the system or building upon it, feel free to explore the code, run the project locally, and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
